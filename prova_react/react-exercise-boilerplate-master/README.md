# React exercise

We need to make a contact list system using react. Our list need an input with a select to find the correct contact.

## What to do?

Create 2 main components inside `./component` folder, one for our input and select and one to visualize our contact list inside a table.
The single row corresponding to our contact need to be a component itself.

You need to filter by first or last name or phone number. You are allowed to use class or functional component.

## Database

Import our contact list from `./data/db.js` file.
